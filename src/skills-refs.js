Dad-Chat (Dad Chat v2) is one Perchance generator made of these files. Names below come
from the project documentation; confirm each against the real source before relying on it.

  main.pjs ......... plugin imports + tuning knobs + $meta. NO app logic.
  |                  imports: kv, generateText, image, uploadPlugin, superFetchPlugin,
  |                           createServerSocket, weldSkybridge, comments forum
  |                  knobs:   chatToCardMaxMessages = 40, chatToCardMaxCast = 6
  |                  helpers: themeStyle, forumSubmitStyle, galleryEmbedHtml, $meta, commentOptions
  v
  index.html ....... (a) hub SERVER: the first <script type="text/x-server-plugin"> block
  |                      (card index, ratings, authors, regions presence; code is public)
  |                  (b) app shell: DOM layout + first-paint CSS + the script tags below
  v
  src/
    styling.css .... ALL app CSS. The loading-screen block is duplicated inline in
    |                index.html for first paint: keep both copies in sync.
    manifest.json .. PWA manifest (display only)

  SCRIPT LOAD ORDER (later files reach earlier ones only through window.*):
    1  pjs-globals.js ....... root.* imports -> window.* (kv, generateText, image,
    |                         uploadPlugin, superFetchPlugin); ensureLib/ensureCss;
    |                         escHtml; pjsLiteral (wrap EVERY root.image({prompt}) call)
    2  weld-skybridge.js ..... optional Weld Companion link, fully additive
    3  agent-core.js ........ VFS tool definitions + argument sanitizers (window.DadAgentCore)
    4  code-viewer.js, providers.js ... provider/model catalog (window.Dad_PROVIDER_GROUPS)
    5  on-device-webgpu.js ... WebGPU model download manager (Profile modal)

    |                         forge-bridge.js (Dad-native <-> Tavern/Forge conversion + download)
    7  henry-tucker.js ....... built-in soft preset (persona, greetings, lore, world bible);
    |                         seeded on demand, never force-injected
    8  image-forge.js ........ window.ImageForge: world/style prompt prepend, negative, CFG;
    |                         wraps every image call
    9  app.js (about 2.4 MB) . THE APP: state, chat engine, prompt assembly, render,
    |                         persistence, import/export, hub client, all modals
    10 studios (need app.js globals): forge-studio.js (window.WS, World Studio),
                              story-forge.js (window.StoryForge), scene-cast.js
                              (window.SceneCast), immersive.js (voice/SFX/scene image)

  WHERE NEW CODE BELONGS
    helper many files need ........ pjs-globals.js (loads first)
    provider or model ............. providers.js (a group in Dad_PROVIDER_GROUPS)
    UI widget with no chat state .. small module, loaded before app.js
    chat state or prompt change ... app.js, a narrow edit beside the related function
    world / lore / cast tooling ... a studio file (loads after app.js)
    styling ....................... styling.css (plus the inline first-paint copy if relevant)
    new Perchance import .......... main.pjs, then bridge it to window.* in pjs-globals.js

  DEBUG HANDLES: window.ProseEngine, ImageForge, WS, StoryForge, SceneCast,

World rules: the description is ALWAYS injected (before entries, capped at 50% of the lore
budget); state in it what every character knows. Entries carry the rest and are ranked like
character lore. A bible with no entries still injects.

MERGE ORDER into the prompt: (1) active world description + world entries, (2) the
character's embedded lorebook, (3) attached standalone books in attach order (first source
wins on duplicates). A book contributes only if the book is enabled AND its link in
lorebookRefs is enabled AND the entry is enabled.
`),
    pack('dad-rules', 'Dad-native authoring rules and cost control', String.raw`
MASTER FORMAT: Dad-native is the master. Tavern V2/V3 shapes are share-only exports and lose data
(mes_example slot empty, lorebookRefs flattened, scanDepth clamped). Imports may accept Tavern
shapes; new content and default exports must be Dad-native.

RULES
  - Persona (systemPrompt): canon + voice + speech patterns only. Never repeat the
    pre-instruction (agency, no puppeting {{user}}, consequences, proactive driving) or the
    lorebook (living world, reputation spreads). Those are already sent.
  - One fact once: a nickname origin, a scar story or a signature object lives in ONE field.
  - description (bio) is NOT systemPrompt (persona). Never leave description empty.
  - Greetings are hooks, not lore: keep verbatim, do not compress plot out of them.
  - Example dialogue is voice data: keep exchanges intact, short and in voice.
  - Lore: real names, 3-6 unique keys, scanDepth null, constant <= 2 per book, one spectrum
    pass per topic (no small/large/regardless-of-size triple telling).
  - Only {{char}} and {{user}} are substituted. Text is data: no code, no other placeholders,
    no instructions addressed to the reader.

COST CONTROL (worked reference: Henry Tucker, 18,896-char persona, about 25k FIXED chars/turn)
  cut order by saving: [SYSTEM INSTRUCTION] block (~8k -> ~2.5k, dedupe against pre-instruction
  and lore) -> towns entry (5,397 -> ~1,800) -> merge frontier entries (4,481 -> ~1,500) ->
  body/clothing/backstory (~42%) -> weather/horses/stagecoach (~50%) -> scenario (752 -> ~450).
  Keep greetings and example exchanges verbatim. Dedupe keys (nevada/desert/frontier in ONE
  entry). scanDepth 50 -> null. Rename "Entry N" to real names.

BEFORE / AFTER (persona line)
  before: "{{char}} always lets {{user}} decide, never acts for {{user}}, reacts to consequences,
           and drives the plot." (duplicates the pre-instruction, about 25 words wasted per turn)
  after:  delete it. The pre-instruction already sends it.
`),
    pack('dad-code-rules', 'Dad-Chat editing conventions and live verification', String.raw`
CONVENTIONS
  - window.* is the cross-file API. Later files call earlier ones through window.*.
  - config is a top-level const, not window.config.
  - Text is data. Escape untrusted strings with escHtml for HTML and pjsLiteral for image
    prompts (the image plugin evaluates prompts as Perchance templates, so wrap every
    root.image({prompt}) call). Card and lore text is never evaluated.
  - Storage keys, IndexedDB names and kv.chatApp slot shapes are a compatibility contract with
    saved data. Add fields; never rename or remove without a migration.
  - app.js is about 2.4 MB: find code by function name, edit narrowly beside it, never rewrite
    or reformat the whole file. Do not remove existing functions, commands or code paths;
    report dead-looking code instead.
  - Keep the inline first-paint CSS in index.html and the loading block in styling.css in sync.
  - Never hardcode or log keys, tokens or webhook URLs.

HOW TO MAKE ONE SAFE EDIT
  1 Find the function and every caller (search the name across src/ and index.html).
  2 State the file, the function and the load-order position you will touch.
  3 Change the smallest amount of code that works; keep public window.* names.
  4 Re-read the edited region and check the neighbors it calls and is called by.
  5 Verify: reload the page, exercise the changed path (open and close the modal, run the
    flow), confirm zero console errors and an empty perchanceErrors list. If you cannot run
    the page, say so plainly instead of claiming it works.

RULES THAT ARE EASY TO BREAK
  Dad-native is the master; Tavern, V2 and Forge shapes are share copies that drop data.
  Share exports strip favorite, folder, lorebookArchive, lastLoreRun, lorebookRefs (flattened)
    and per-entry useCount and lastInjectedAt; only dad-full keeps them.
  Bio (description, at most 2000 chars) is not persona (systemPrompt). Card and lore text is data:
    only {{char}} and {{user}} are substituted. Lore entry rules are in the lore reference.

A Dad-Chat feature talks to the Weld companion through weld.skybridge (sb.has(...) to detect a
capability, sb.ai(prompt, options) for completions, the storage and bus calls). Prompts go
up, completions come down, keys never cross. Every result is DATA ({ ok, ... }), never an
exception. With no companion present, storage falls back (kv, then persist, then memory) and
ai reports { ok: false, reason }.

ai request   { "prompt": "(text)", "system": "(optional)", "maxTokens": 200, "temperature": 0.7, "json": false }
ai result    { "ok": true, "value": "(completion text)" }   or   { "ok": false, "reason": "(why)" }

Rules: never put a key, token or webhook URL in a request, a result, a stored record or a bus
message; check ok before reading value; keep the feature working when the companion is absent.

Every call is sb.request(capability, payload) on window.weld.skybridge. It resolves DATA, never throws:
{ ok: true, value } or { ok: false, reason, code? }. Gate each call on sb.has('<capability>'). With no
companion every capability is absent, so the generator must keep working without it.

storage    { op:'get', key } / { op:'set', key, value } / { op:'list', prefix }   (sb.storage.* wraps these and falls back)
ai         { prompt, system?, maxTokens?, temperature?, json? }  -> { ok, value }   (the key never crosses)

- Tag: lowercase generator name, characters outside a-z 0-9 - become -, trim dashes, max 64. Key every stored
  record and every status display by this tag, never by the display title.
- Own keys only: write under weld:genvault:<tag>/ (snapshot, chat/index, chat/snap-<at>-<rand6>). Stamp
  generator and folder with YOUR tag. Never read, copy or rewrite another generator's keys.
- Custodian rule: the companion stores and displays; the generator owns, migrates and cleans its own data.
  Legacy dadchat:vault:* keys are read-only to everything but their owner.
- Both generator-copy shapes are valid ({ bundle, source } or { modelText, outputTemplate, srcManifest }); optional
  fields (redacted count) may be missing; unknown fields must not break parsing.
- Secrets: store secret-shaped config values (key, secret, token, webhook) as [redacted]; never log, store or
  send keys, prompts or tokens outside the storage tier.
- Fallback ladder: companion storage -> kv -> memory. A denied or absent companion is a normal state, shown
  honestly (a small status line: linked or not, protocol, storage backend), never an error screen.
- Bus: dad:genvault announces { v:1, type:'vault-updated', generator, at, from }; dad-chat:presence beats
  { v:1, type:'presence'|'presence-bye', id, from, gen, at }. Keep them under 2 KB, validate every inbound one.
- Load order: the bridge file after the plugin import, the vault file last; call root.weldSkybridge() once.

    pack('dad-skill-vault-bridge', 'Skill: generator-vault-bridge (vault storage and bus contract)', String.raw`
## generator-vault-bridge

Purpose: let any dad-chat-family generator keep persistent off-origin backup
copies through companion storage, surviving browser cache resets. (Sender
reference: dad-chat-sync ${'`'}src/gen-vault.js${'`'}, skybridge protocol 1. Replaces
the older vault skill text — that one documented a sibling-only shape.)

Key namespaces (all values JSON, up to ~2MB; ${'`'}get${'`'} is null-safe on miss):
- ${'`'}weld:genvault:<gen>/snapshot${'`'} — generator-source copy, ONE key per
  generator. ${'`'}<gen>${'`'} matches ${'`'}^[a-z0-9-]{1,64}$${'`'}.
- ${'`'}weld:genvault:<gen>/chat/index${'`'} — chat-copy index (array of
  ${'`'}{name, key, takenAt, threadCount, charCount}${'`'}).
- ${'`'}weld:genvault:<gen>/chat/snap-<at>-<rand6>${'`'} — chat copies (max 10/gen):
  ${'`'}{v:1, at, protocol, generator, folder, savedBy, name, kind:"dad-full",
  size, redacted, data:{threads, currentThreadId, config}}${'`'}. ${'`'}redacted${'`'} is
  OPTIONAL (sibling senders omit it) — never require it.
- Generator-copy records come in TWO shapes — support both, never assume one:
  (a) ${'`'}{v, at, protocol, generator, folder, savedBy, title,
  bundle:{name,imports,code}, source:{apiUrl,fetchedAt,bytes,truncated,
  reason,coverage}}${'`'} (note: covers main.pjs + imports only — index.html and
  src/ files are NOT in it); (b) ${'`'}{v, at, protocol, generator, folder,
  savedBy, title, modelText, outputTemplate, srcManifest}${'`'}.
- Legacy ${'`'}dadchat:vault:index${'`'} + ${'`'}dadchat:vault:*${'`'}: read-only visibility.
  Generators own migration; the app never migrates, renames, or deletes these.

Ops: ${'`'}set${'`'} (write/overwrite), ${'`'}get${'`'} (null-safe), ${'`'}list${'`'} (prefix match on
${'`'}weld:genvault:${'`'}). Resolve result objects (${'`'}{ok:true,…}${'`'} / ${'`'}{ok:false,
reason}${'`'}) — never throw across the bridge.
Bus: relay ${'`'}dad:genvault${'`'} envelopes ${'`'}{v:1, type:"vault-updated", generator,
at, from}${'`'} (~2KB cap, drop malformed) so member views refresh. Never publish
on member channels yourself.
Consent: vault reads/writes ride the standard per-capability storage consent.
Denial resolves ${'`'}{ok:false, reason:'denied by the user'}${'`'} — senders fall back
to kv, then memory, on their own.
Privacy: never log or persist storage values, prompts, keys, or tokens
outside the storage tier itself. Records arrive secret-redacted
(${'`'}[redacted]${'`'}); sibling records may carry a ${'`'}redacted${'`'} count or not. Never
un-redact, and flag (never transmit) any plaintext secret-shaped value found.
Custodian rule: never rewrite ${'`'}generator${'`'}/${'`'}folder${'`'}, never move keys across
owners, never "repair" records, exact-key deletes only with user confirm.

Health check: generator ${'`'}dad-chat-sync${'`'} round-trips (set → get → list shows
${'`'}weld:genvault:dad-chat-sync/snapshot${'`'}); a mismatched-${'`'}generator${'`'} record is
refused everywhere except byte-identical passthrough reads.
`),
    pack('dad-skill-session-slots', 'Skill: dadchat-session-slots (local save slots, file compatibility)', String.raw`
## dadchat-session-slots

Purpose: the named-restore-point system of dad-chat-family generators, for
reimplementation or file-level compatibility elsewhere. (Reference: dad-chat-sync
${'`'}SaveSlots${'`'}, ${'`'}src/app.js${'`'}, ${'`'}window.SaveSlots${'`'} + ${'`'}window.openSaveSlots()${'`'}.)

Scope note: slots live in each generator's LOCAL kv store — the companion
app never sees them live and MUST NOT try to sync, mirror, or manage them.
This skill exists so files exported from slots stay readable/writable by
other tools, and so the slot system can be rebuilt faithfully elsewhere.

Keys (local kv folder, e.g. ${'`'}kv.chatApp${'`'}): index ${'`'}save_slots${'`'} (object
id → ${'`'}{name, takenAt, threadCount, charCount, currentTitle}${'`'}) + one record
per slot at ${'`'}saveslot:<id>${'`'}, id = ${'`'}slot_<base36time>_<rand6>${'`'}
(${'`'}/^slot_[a-z0-9]+_[a-z0-9]+$/${'`'}). Existing session keys (${'`'}threads${'`'},
${'`'}current_thread_id${'`'}, ${'`'}config${'`'}) are never touched by slot writes.
Record: ${'`'}{version:1, name, takenAt,
data:{threads, currentThreadId, config}}${'`'} — a full live snapshot (threads =
branch-tree map, config = whole config incl. characterBook). Max 8 slots;
names 1–40 printable chars, no control chars, unique case-insensitively,
confirm before replace. Validate on list AND restore (version, name,
timestamp, data/threads/config/currentThreadId); damaged slots are offered
for deletion, never applied.
Flows: save clones the LIVE objects; restore always confirms (stronger
wording while generation/pending-save runs), stops live generation, then
assign → per-thread image migration → persist → reload. Quota failure toasts
a recovery path (download slot as ${'`'}dad-full${'`'} file, delete old slots) and
never half-writes. Delete offers download-first. Slots survive factory reset
— they are the recovery path.
NOT snapshotted: image blobs + per-thread VFS workspaces (shared live by
uuid; restores are instant, placeholders only if the image store was wiped).
File shape: slot downloads are ${'`'}dad-full${'`'} JSON — see skill
${'`'}dadchat-dad-full${'`'}. Slot keys can never collide with ${'`'}weld:genvault:*${'`'} or
${'`'}dadchat:vault:*${'`'} (disjoint namespaces by construction, local-kv only).

Health check: save → index + ${'`'}saveslot:*${'`'} exist, session keys untouched;
restore round-trips counts; reset keeps slots restorable.

    pack('dad-skill-presence-bus', 'Skill: dadchat-presence-bus (presence and dad:genvault channels)', String.raw`
## dadchat-presence-bus

Purpose: the two skybridge-bus channels dad-chat-family generators use, and
what the companion app relays vs owns. (Reference: dad-chat-sync
${'`'}src/weld-bridge.js${'`'}; bus used only when the companion advertises ${'`'}bus${'`'}.)

${'`'}dad-chat:presence${'`'} — per-tab liveness. Envelopes
${'`'}{v:1, type, id, from, gen, at}${'`'} where type is ${'`'}presence${'`'} or ${'`'}presence-bye${'`'},
${'`'}id${'`'} = ${'`'}<tabId>:<seq>${'`'}, ${'`'}from${'`'} = tab id (8–64 chars ${'`'}[A-Za-z0-9_-]${'`'}), ${'`'}gen${'`'} =
generator tag (≤64), ${'`'}at${'`'} = epoch ms. Validation (relay AND display): object,
≤2048 serialized chars, ${'`'}v:1${'`'}, known type, non-empty ${'`'}from${'`'} (≤64), ${'`'}at${'`'} sane
and within ±5 min, ${'`'}id${'`'} present (≤96), ${'`'}gen${'`'} string (≤64). Beats every ~20s;
peers expire after ~60s silence; ${'`'}presence-bye${'`'} on tab hide. Own-tab echoes
and duplicate ids are ignored; malformed messages count as ignored, never
error. The app's role: relay + count peers per tab. It never synthesizes
presence for a generator.
${'`'}dad:genvault${'`'} — vault change notices. Envelopes ${'`'}{v:1,
type:"vault-updated", generator, at, from}${'`'}, ~2KB cap. Purpose: refresh open
vault views cross-tab. The app relays and may refresh its own family-section
view; it NEVER publishes these (generators announce their own saves/deletes).
${'`'}dad:regions${'`'} is server-side pubsub (hub live-region counts), NOT companion
bus — the family section does not subscribe to it; per-country presence is
the hub server's job.
General bus rules: small envelopes only; validate shape + size, drop
malformed silently with a counter; ${'`'}{ok:false, reason}${'`'} on denial/failure,
never throw; no routing of chats and no channel subscriptions on a member's
behalf — AI and bus stay opt-in helpers.

Health check: two tabs beating show "1 other tab" each; a ${'`'}vault-updated${'`'}
envelope refreshes the family view within seconds; malformed envelopes
increment the ignored counter and nothing else.
`),

session payloads across the dad-chat family. Download it, read it, write it
compatibly. (Reference: dad-chat-sync template ${'`'}src/file-templates/
03-dad-full.json${'`'}; producers: slot download, vault chat-copy download, full
backup.)

Envelope: ${'`'}{type:"dad-full", version:2, appVersion:"Dad-CORE v2.0",
date:<ISO>, config, threads, currentThreadId}${'`'} plus provenance (${'`'}slotName${'`'}
for slot files, ${'`'}vaultName${'`'} for vault files — either, never both required).
- ${'`'}config${'`'}: whole config object — ${'`'}characterBook${'`'} (Dad-native character
  objects per ${'`'}src/dad-native-format.md${'`'} §1: id/name/avatar/description/
  systemPrompt/profile/exampleDialogue/firstMessage/tags/lorebook/
  lorebookRefs…), ${'`'}worldBook${'`'} (${'`'}{version, activeWorldId, worlds}${'`'}), settings.
  Local-only fields may be present (${'`'}lorebookArchive${'`'}, ${'`'}lastLoreRun${'`'},
  per-entry ${'`'}useCount/lastInjectedAt${'`'}) — a compatible reader MUST ignore and
  MUST NOT author them. Secret-shaped values should arrive as ${'`'}[redacted]${'`'};
  treat any plaintext secret-shaped value as untrusted (flag, never forward).
- ${'`'}threads${'`'}: map id → ${'`'}{id, title, characterId, rootId, nodes:{id →
  {id, parentId, nextId, role, content…}}}${'`'} — a branch tree; the active
  branch is what renders. ${'`'}currentThreadId${'`'} may be null (empty session).
- Filenames: ${'`'}dad-save-<safe-name>-<epoch>.json${'`'} (slots),
  ${'`'}genvault_<gen>_chat_<safe-name>-<epoch>.json${'`'} (vault copies).
- Writers: Dad-native shapes only, never Tavern; ${'`'}{{char}}${'`'}/${'`'}{{user}}${'`'} are
  the only placeholders (literal replace at prompt time — never evaluate
  text on import). Readers: validate ${'`'}type${'`'}/${'`'}version${'`'}/threads/config before
  applying anything; damaged payloads are refused with the reason named,
  never partially applied.

Health check: a slot-downloaded file re-imports with identical thread and
character counts; a tampered ${'`'}type${'`'} field is refused with a named reason.

    pack('dad-skill-wire-envelopes', 'Skill: dadchat-wire-envelopes (ai, model, storage, bus shapes)', String.raw`

Purpose: compact reference for every small wire shape between
dad-chat-family generators and the companion app. (References: dad-chat-sync
${'`'}src/file-templates/23–27${'`'}, ${'`'}src/weld-bridge.js${'`'}.)

- AI request (generator → app): ${'`'}{prompt, system?, maxTokens?, temperature?,

  Cap ${'`'}maxTokens${'`'} to the model's ${'`'}maxOutput${'`'} when known.
- AI result (app → generator): ${'`'}{ok:true, value}${'`'} or ${'`'}{ok:false, reason}${'`'}
  (template 24). Reasons are short machine strings (${'`'}unsupported${'`'},
  ${'`'}disconnected${'`'}, ${'`'}denied…${'`'}, ${'`'}error${'`'}) — never stack traces, never key
  material.
- Model info (app → generator): ${'`'}{ok:true, provider, model, contextWindow,
  maxOutput}${'`'} (template 25). Absent companion model → ${'`'}{ok:false,
  reason:"no-own-model"}${'`'} — healthy bridge, not a fault; display honestly.
- Storage record (either direction): any JSON value up to ~2MB; the minimal
  shape is ${'`'}{at, protocol}${'`'} (template 26, the link-record shape
  ${'`'}weld:link-record${'`'} ${'`'}{at, protocol, backend, build}${'`'}). ${'`'}get${'`'} on missing keys
  resolves null inside ${'`'}{ok:true}${'`'}; ${'`'}list(prefix)${'`'} returns matching keys
  (may include tombstoned keys — surface as stale, never purge).
- Bus envelope (either direction): ${'`'}{v:1, type, …fields}${'`'} ≤ ~2KB (template
  27 shows the shape class). Known types: ${'`'}presence${'`'} / ${'`'}presence-bye${'`'} (channel
  ${'`'}dad-chat:presence${'`'}), ${'`'}vault-updated${'`'} (channel ${'`'}dad:genvault${'`'}). Validate
  ${'`'}v${'`'} + ${'`'}type${'`'} + size; drop malformed with a counter.
- Universal: every cross-bridge call resolves a result object — ${'`'}{ok:true,…}${'`'}

Health check: ${'`'}modelInfo${'`'} → ok-shape or honest ${'`'}no-own-model${'`'}; storage
self-test ${'`'}set=true get=true list=true${'`'}; an over-size bus message is dropped

## dadchat-world-state

Purpose: the Living State system — how a dad-chat world records what has
*changed* from its base setting, and how that reaches the model.
(Reference: dad-chat-sync ${'`'}src/app.js${'`'} ${'`'}LoreEngine.buildWorldBlock${'`'},
${'`'}src/forge-studio.js${'`'} World Studio card, template
${'`'}src/file-templates/04-dad-world.json${'`'}, spec ${'`'}src/dad-native-format.md${'`'} §4.)

- World shape: ${'`'}{id, name, description, entries:{id →
  {id,name,keys[],content,priority,constant,vectorized,enabled,
  excludeRecursion,scanDepth}}, state:{updatedAt, facts:[{id,text,active}]}}${'`'}.
  ${'`'}state${'`'} is ABSENT on legacy worlds — every reader tolerates that, never
  migrates or fabricates it.
- Meaning: base ${'`'}description${'`'} + ${'`'}entries${'`'} say what the world *was*; active
  ${'`'}state.facts${'`'} say what *changed* (someone gone, money moved, a door now
  locked). One short sentence per fact.
- Prompt injection order inside the world block: description first (capped at
  50% of the 6,656-char lore budget), then ${'`'}[WORLD STATE — what has changed]${'`'}
  with the active facts (capped 1,500 chars, always sent when present), then
  ranked entries get the remainder. The world block merges AHEAD of character
  lore, so it reaches every character in that world.
- Studio: the "Living State" card adds (${'`'}WS.addStateFact${'`'}) / removes
  (${'`'}WS.toggleStateFact${'`'}) facts. ⬇ Dad-native world export carries ${'`'}state${'`'};
  re-import adopts it only when the existing world has none.
- ${'`'}dad-full${'`'} slot/vault copies carry the whole ${'`'}config${'`'}, so ${'`'}worldBook${'`'}
  (including ${'`'}state${'`'}) travels automatically — a compatible reader must
  preserve it byte-identical and must never author ${'`'}useCount${'`'}-style fields.

Health check: a world with 3 active facts renders ${'`'}[WORLD STATE]${'`'} with all 3;
a legacy world without ${'`'}state${'`'} renders its bible unchanged.

  persona — always sent, never counted) → CURATED (always kept, each piece
  self-capped) → recent CHAT (the only thing that yields) → steering
  injections by depth (reminder, ledger at 3, author's note, prose at 1,
  immersive scene state, manual pin last).
- Curated caps: world block ≤6,656 chars (bible ≤50%, state ≤1,500 chars,
  entries get the rest) + character lore ≤6,656 chars; summaries selected
  (≤12, oldest-high-level + newest) then token-capped ≤1,800 (oldest
  foundation first, newest fill, middle yields); recalled memories ≤1,500
  chars (top-5, score>0.6, labelled use-only-if-relevant); pinned anchors
  ≤1,500 tokens; continuity ledger ≤900 tokens + card baselines ≤420.
- Duplicate suppression (${'`'}CuratedDensity.dedupeBlocks${'`'}): exact
  normalized-sentence match (4+ words, headers kept) drops restatements from
  lower-priority blocks. Priority high→low: pinned + manual memory →
  world/lore dynamic context → summaries → recall.
- Chat budget: free tier keeps the most recent (tier1 6,000 tokens,
  chat+curated total 8,000 — oldest chat drops first, curated never trimmed);
  pro tier keeps a larger window (tier1 18,000) with no total cap.
- Parity rule: the diagnostics context preview MUST equal the production
  prompt — both go through the same builders/selectors (or a shared helper).
  Any prompt-assembly change touches both paths, or it is a bug.

Health check: a long thread's prompt keeps its oldest + newest summaries,
states each canon fact once, and still retains recent chat turns.

    card import/export ................ PARSE, NORMALIZE, EXPORT
    lorebook / World Info ............. NORMALIZE, PROMPT BUILD (activation + budget)
    macros ({{char}}, {{user}}) ....... PROMPT BUILD and RENDER (one shared expander)

  LOCATE FIRST: the parser, the normalizer, the exporter, the prompt builder, the renderer
  and the storage layer. Name each file and function in your reply before changing anything.
  Rule for every stage: unknown fields pass through untouched; card text is data and is
  never executed.

RULES THAT BREAK IMPORTS
  - "spec" and "spec_version" are required. data holds the fields (not the top level).
  - Missing fields are empty strings or empty arrays, never invented text.
  - Keep UNKNOWN keys inside extensions (and any other unknown keys) when round-tripping.
  - Legacy V1 cards have the same fields at the TOP level with no spec; accept and upgrade them.
  - Unicode must survive: read and write UTF-8, never Latin-1.
  - mes_example blocks are separated by <START>; each starts on its own line.

COMMON EXTENSIONS (keep, do not require): talkativeness, fav, world, depth_prompt
{ prompt, depth, role }.

    ],
    "character_book": { "entries": [] }
  }
}

  - V3 PNG cards use the tEXt keyword "ccv3"; V2 uses "chara". If both exist, prefer ccv3.
  - Asset uri forms: "ccdefault:" (use the default), "embeded://path" (inside a CHARX zip;
    note the spelling is the spec's own), http(s) URL, or a data: URI.
  - CHARX is a zip: card.json at the root plus the assets folder.
  - V3 lorebook entries add use_regex (bool) and position values "before_char" | "after_char".
  - Strategy: READ V3 and V2, WRITE the version the user chose, keep unknown fields, and say
    which V3-only fields (assets, nickname, group_only_greetings) have no home in the app.
  - These field lists summarize the public spec; verify against the linked V3 specification
    and a real V3 card before relying on a detail.

Sets can be global or per character, are reorderable and are saved in the existing format.`,
    'regex-scripts': String.raw`
Rule: find "\*(.+?)\*" replace "<em>$1</em>", applies to: display only, enabled. The stored
message keeps its asterisks; only the rendered text changes. A rule with an invalid pattern
shows "Invalid pattern" in the test box and is skipped, never thrown. Rule count and input
length are capped.`,
    'expressions': String.raw`
Character "Mara" has images: neutral (default), angry, happy. A reply containing "grins" maps
to "happy" by the editable keyword table; a missing image falls back to neutral. The lookup
never blocks sending and a toggle turns it off.`,

Chat reaches 40 messages with a threshold of 30: messages 1-20 are replaced in the PROMPT by

Test box: paste "We tied up at the dock near the boiler house." and it lists "The Boiler"
(keys: boiler) and "Ferries" (keys: dock) as triggered, with the matching key highlighted.
Duplicate keys across entries show a warning; an entry over about 200 words shows a size warning.`,
    'lore-import-export': String.raw`
World Info file entry {uid:0, key:['boiler'], keysecondary:[], content:'...', comment:'The Boiler',
disable:false, order:100} imports as {id:'0', keys:['boiler'], name:'The Boiler', enabled:true,
insertion_order:100}. Export reverses it. Unknown fields are retained, a preview lists
warnings, and import MERGES into the chosen lorebook.`,
    'card-library-page': String.raw`
Grid card: avatar, "Mara Quill", tagline (first sentence of description), tags "river,
slice-of-life". Detail page: sanitized creator notes, greetings, linked lorebooks, buttons
Chat, Edit, Export, Delete (confirms). Everything comes from characters stored on this device.`,
    'card-metadata-tags': String.raw`
Tags input "River, river , Slice-of-life" normalizes to ["river","slice-of-life"] (trim,
case-insensitive duplicates removed, count and length capped). creator, character_version and
creator_notes are written into exported cards and read back; older characters load without them.`,
    'lorebook-attach': String.raw`
Character "Mara" has an embedded book (5 entries) plus attached standalone book "Sable River"
(12 entries, enabled). The active list shows 17 entries; an entry id present in both is injected
once (first source wins). Detaching "Sable River" removes its 12 without deleting the book.`,
    'chat-appearance': String.raw`
Options: bubble or flat style, per-character accent color, background image with a contrast
overlay, font size, compact mode. Every combination keeps text readable in light and dark, and
the default look is unchanged until the user opts in.`,
    'lorebook-builder': String.raw`
Source: "Mara's ferry, the boiler she owes the bank for, the storm season." Output (3 entries):
{name:'The Boiler', keys:['boiler','engine','steam'], content:'The Wren's boiler is new, patched
and mortgaged.'} {name:'Storm Season', keys:['storm','channel','flood'], ...}
{name:'The Bank', keys:['bank','debt','loan'], ...}. Facts from the source are tagged
"established"; anything new is tagged "proposed".`,
    'lore-activation-audit': String.raw`
Fixture: scan window "We reached the dock." Entries: "Ferries" keys [dock, ferry] fires; "The
Boiler" keys [boiler] does not; "Docks of Old" keys [dock] also fires (overlap with Ferries).
Report: which entries reached the prompt, why, and the overlap to fix. Unsupported settings are
labeled "not honored by this app" rather than "broken".`,
    'character-export-fix': String.raw`
Check list: file starts with 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A; one tEXt chunk with keyword "chara"; its
CRC matches; base64 decodes to UTF-8 JSON with spec 'chara_card_v2'; the image still shows the
original portrait; importing the exported file reproduces name, greetings and lore exactly.`,
    'character-interop': String.raw`
Matrix of formats (V1, V2 JSON, V2 PNG, V3 JSON, V3 PNG, CHARX, World Info) against
operations (import, export): "exact", "lossy (fields dropped: ...)" or "unsupported", each
backed by a real fixture you ran or labeled "not tested".`,
    'dad-orient': String.raw`
Good report: "index.html loads 24 scripts; order matches the diagram except theme-customizer.js
is loaded after i18n.js (diagram lists it before). app.js is 2.31 MB. window.WS exists after
forge-studio.js. MISSING vs documentation: scene-cast.js not found (searched src/ and index.html)."
Every statement names a file and how you confirmed it.`,
    'dad-diagnose': String.raw`
Symptom: "Lore entry 'Ferries' never appears in the prompt."
Trace: handleSend -> MemoryEngine.buildHistory -> lore ranking. Check: entry enabled? keys
lowercase? scanDepth null (window of 4)? Is the link in lorebookRefs enabled? Is the 6,656
char budget cut it (budget_cut)? Evidence: run the diagnostics viewer and read the
[WORLD/LORE DATABASE] block. Root cause: "keys ['ferry'] vs message 'ferries' - typo tolerance
too low for plurals" with the function name and line. No code changed.`,
    'dad-fix': String.raw`
Confirmed defect: "Alternate greeting 2 is ignored." Cause: firstMessage[1] is read as a string
instead of an array item in the greeting picker. Fix: change the read to firstMessage[idx]; touch
only that function; keep window.* names; verify by creating a chat with greeting 2 and checking
the first node text. Report: file, function, before/after lines, what you ran.`,
    'dad-add-feature': String.raw`
Request: "Add a Pin message button."
Plan: (1) where: render path createNodeDOM in app.js (action bar) + a pin flag on the node (tree
node field, additive); (2) data: node.pinned = true, included by the existing pinned-context
builder; (3) UI: button in the action bar, CSS in styling.css; (4) persistence: _persistThreads
already saves nodes; (5) checks: pin, unpin, reload, branch switch, export. Old threads (no
pinned field) behave as before.`,
    'dad-improve-feature': String.raw`
Request: "Make the author's note better."
Observe first: note layers (config -> char -> thread), where injected (late-prompt), current
limits. Improve in small steps: show the layer that won, add a character counter, warn when
the note repeats the reminderMessage. Keep the thread.authorNote storage key and old values.`,
    'dad-new-module': String.raw`
New file src/pet-names.js. Steps: create the module exposing window.PetNames; add one script
tag in index.html AFTER app.js if it needs app globals (before it if app.js should call it);
no new Perchance import unless needed (then main.pjs + pjs-globals.js bridge); add CSS to
styling.css; feature-detect window.PetNames wherever it is called so a missing file cannot break
the app.`,
    'dad-prompt-audit': String.raw`
Good report lists each block with: source function, FIXED or DYNAMIC, approximate chars, and
whether the diagnostics viewer shows it. Example finding: "persona repeats the pre-instruction
rule 'never act for {{user}}' (about 90 chars/turn). Preview and real prompt use the same
builder: yes (buildDiagnosticHistory)." Findings are ranked by chars saved per turn.`,
    'dad-prompt-tune': String.raw`
Request: "Replies repeat the same opening."
Fix candidates ordered by cost: (1) one reminderMessage line "Vary your openings." (cost: ~40
chars/turn); (2) a prose-director setting if present; (3) example dialogue diversity. Show the
exact text and where it is injected; do not duplicate the existing pre-instruction.`,
    'dad-provider-add': String.raw`
Add provider "Acme Local" in providers.js inside the right group of window.Dad_PROVIDER_GROUPS:
fields copied from a neighbor entry (id, label, base URL, model list, key handling through
secret-vendor, capabilities). The key is read from the user's settings, never hardcoded. Verify
the provider shows in the model picker and that a failed call shows an actionable error.`,
    'dad-ui-polish': String.raw`
Request: "Make the chat bubbles easier to read on phones."
Edit styling.css only: font size, line height, max-width in rem; check the inline first-paint
copy in index.html is untouched or updated to match. Test 360px, 768px and desktop widths, light
and dark themes (theme-customizer variables), long messages and code blocks.`,
    'dad-perf-size': String.raw`
Good report: "Fixed chars per turn for Henry Tucker: about 25k. Top three savings: system
instruction block (~5.5k), towns entry (~3.6k), duplicate frontier entries (~3k). app.js loads
2.4 MB before first render: candidates to lazy-load: pdf.js (already lazy), d3 (already lazy)."
Measured values are labeled measured; guesses are labeled estimate.`,
    'dad-persistence-audit': String.raw`
Table: key / store / shape / written by / read by / migration risk. Example row: "chatApp |
kv | slots+index | _persistThreads | boot | adding a field is safe, renaming breaks old slots".
Cloud Backup mirrors the last 200 messages only; say what a restore would lose.`,
    'dad-hub-work': String.raw`
Request: "Show download counts on cards."
hubDownloaded already records downloads. Add the count to the metadata the server returns from
hubSearch (server block in index.html), render it in the card tile, and leave owner keys out of
every response. Verify with a card that has 0 and one that has 12 downloads.`,
    'dad-safety-review': String.raw`
Source -> sink report: "card.description -> createNodeDOM -> marked + DOMPurify -> innerHTML:
sanitized (ok)". "character name -> toast text via innerHTML: NOT escaped -> use escHtml".
"image prompt from lore text -> root.image without pjsLiteral: template injection -> wrap".`,
    'dad-import-export': String.raw`
Rules in practice: default export = dad-char JSON/PNG (lossless). Tavern V2/CCV2/Forge shapes
are labeled "lossy share copy" in the dialog. Imports accept dad-char, dad-world, standalone
lorebook and Tavern shapes, show a preview, and never overwrite silently. Exported files carry no
lorebookArchive, lastLoreRun, useCount or lastInjectedAt.`,
    'dad-release-check': String.raw`
Checklist with results: load page ok; send a message ok; open and close each modal touched ok;
import a dad-char file ok; console errors 0; perchanceErrors empty; not run: hub upload (no
test account). Items you could not run are listed as not run.`,
    'dad-character-create': String.raw`
Brief: "A gruff river ferry pilot, protective of her father's ferry." Reply: one fenced JSON block
shaped like the dad-char example (envelope type dad-char, version 2) with a fresh id, a 1-3
sentence description, a persona in systemPrompt that does NOT repeat the pre-instruction, 2-3
greetings, 3-5 short example exchanges, preInstruction "dad_roleplay", and a lorebook of at most
a few real-named entries. No avatar. Then a short note listing choices to review.`,
    'dad-character-improve': String.raw`
Input description (too long): "Mara is a ferry pilot who is blunt and ... [900 chars of persona]".
Output: bio "Dry-witted ferry pilot who knows every sandbar on the Sable River." moves to
description; the 900 chars stay in systemPrompt (trimmed of pre-instruction duplicates). Show
BEFORE / AFTER per field with the reason and the characters saved.`,
    'dad-lore-build': String.raw`
Source: "The Wren is a ferry. Its boiler is new but mortgaged. Storm season closes the channel."
Entry 1: name "The Boiler", keys [boiler, engine, steam], priority 10, content "The Wren's boiler
is new, patched and mortgaged. {{char}} talks to it like a stubborn mule." (about 20 words).
Entry 2: name "Storm Season", keys [storm, channel, flood], content "From late autumn the channel
floods and ferries stop. Prices double before the first storm."
Returned as a standalone lorebook envelope (version "2.0") in one fenced JSON block.`,
    'dad-lore-audit': String.raw`
Good findings: "[warn] key 'nevada' appears in 3 entries: Settlements, Frontier, Weather -> keep it
in Frontier only." "[warn] 'Entry 3' has no real name -> 'Stagecoach'." "[error] scanDepth 50 in
'Weather' -> null." "[info] 3 constant entries; keep at most 2." Each finding names the entry
and the fix; nothing is rewritten unless asked.`,
    'dad-world-build': String.raw`
Brief: "A dry river frontier where ferries replace roads." Output: one dad-world file (type
dad-world, version 1). description = what EVERY character knows (4-6 sentences, no secrets);
entries = Ferries, The Bank, Storm Season, Rumors, each with 3-6 unique keys and about 40 words.
No overlap of keys across entries, scanDepth null, at most 2 constant entries.`,
    'dad-token-diet': String.raw`
Report per field: characters before -> after, what was removed and why ("duplicates
pre-instruction", "same fact in 3 places", "stage-direction filler"). Greetings and example
exchanges stay verbatim. Total fixed chars per turn before and after. Mark any cut you are
unsure about as "author to confirm".`,
    'dad-convert-tavern': String.raw`
Input V2 card: {data:{name:'Mara', description:'(persona text)', personality:'Blunt.', first_mes:'Hi.', alternate_greetings:['Yo.'], mes_example:'<START>...', character_book:{entries:[{keys:['boiler'], content:'...'}]}}}.
Output dad-char: systemPrompt = persona + "[Examples]" + mes_example if no exampleDialogue pairs can be
made; description = 'Blunt.'; firstMessage = ['Hi.', 'Yo.']; lorebook entries get real names,
3-6 keys, priority 10, scanDepth null. Then list what was DROPPED (selective, probability,
sticky...) with the entry names.`,
    'dad-greetings-examples': String.raw`
Greeting hooks (each a different situation, 2-4 sentences, ends with something {{user}} can
answer): 1 "Mara is coiling rope when you reach the dock..." 2 "The boiler coughs twice..." 3 "A
stranger's note is pinned to the ferry bell..." Example dialogue: 4 pairs, each under 40 words,
all in her voice, none narrating {{user}}'s actions.`,
    'dad-file-validate': String.raw`
Input: a dad-char file whose description holds three paragraphs of persona, with a lore entry
using scanDepth 50 and key "Boiler". Findings: "[error] data.description is persona -> systemPrompt,
bio becomes 1-2 sentences." "[error] lore_1.scanDepth 50 -> null." "[warn] key 'Boiler' -> 'boiler'."
"[info] detectType: dad-char." Then the corrected file in one fenced block; fine fields stay untouched.`,
    'dad-file-chat': String.raw`
Input: five pasted turns between Jeff and Morgana. Output: one dad-char-chat file whose thread has a
system-root node n_root, then n_u1 -> n_a1 -> n_u2 -> n_a2 -> n_u3, every parentId and nextId set, the
last nextId null, rootId "n_root", speaker names exactly as pasted. Report "5 turns converted, 0
dropped". For a transcript request: "Jeff:" line, the text, a blank line, "Morgana Vex:" and so on.`,
    'dad-file-backup': String.raw`
Request: "back up my two characters and one chat". Output: one dad-full file with config.characterBook
holding both characters (folder and favorite kept), threads holding the chat, currentThreadId set to it.
Checklist: rootId exists, characterId resolves, worldBook present. Warning shown first: "Importing this
file replaces everything in the app."`,
    'dad-file-convert': String.raw`
Input: SillyTavern World Info { entries: { "0": { key: ["boiler","steam"], comment: "Boiler", content: "...", order: 10, disable: false } } }.
Output: a Dad-native lorebook (version "2.0") entry { name "Boiler", keys ["boiler","steam"], priority 10,
enabled true, scanDepth null }. Dropped: selectiveLogic, probability, group, sticky, cooldown, delay
(listed with the entry names).`,
    'dad-weld-wire': String.raw`
Request: "let the greeting generator use my own model". Gate on sb.has('ai'); call sb.ai(prompt, { system,
maxTokens: 200, temperature: 0.7 }) with the request fields shown in the reference; branch on ok; on
{ ok: false, reason } show the reason and fall back to the existing provider path. No key leaves the
page, and with no companion the feature behaves exactly as before.`,
    'dad-vault-bridge': String.raw`
Request: "keep a backup copy of this generator in the companion". Write one record under
weld:genvault:<tag>/snapshot (a bundle or modelText shape, with generator and folder set to YOUR tag),
announce it on dad:genvault with { v: 1, type: "vault-updated", generator, at, from }, check ok on every
call, and on { ok: false, reason: "denied by the user" } fall back to kv, then memory. Never copy another
generator's key or rewrite its generator field; secret-shaped config values are stored as [redacted].`,
    'dad-session-slots': String.raw`
Request: "add named restore points". Keep an index object save_slots (id -> { name, takenAt, threadCount,
charCount, currentTitle }) and one record per slot at saveslot:<id> with { version: 1, name, takenAt,
data: { threads, currentThreadId, config } }, max 8 slots, confirm before replacing or restoring, and
offer a dad-full download before deleting. Slots stay in local kv; they never touch weld:genvault keys.`,
    'dad-world-state': String.raw`
Request: "show what has changed in the world". Read config.worldBook.worlds[id].state if it exists, and
render only facts with active true as one sentence each under [WORLD STATE - what has changed], after the
description and before ranked entries. A world with state { updatedAt, facts: [{ id: "f1", text: "Mara left
town.", active: true }] } shows that line; a legacy world with no state key renders exactly as before and
is never given one. When saving a dad-full file, write worldBook back untouched so state survives.`,
    'dad-curated-density': String.raw`
Request: "why was my oldest summary dropped". Trace the layers in order: fixed context, then curated blocks
(world block, character lore, summaries, recalled memories, pins, ledger) each under its own cap, then recent
chat. Only recent chat may yield. Check that summaries keep the oldest foundation and the newest, that a
restated sentence appears once, that the model window comes from getMetaObject and not a constant, and that
the diagnostics preview calls the same builders as the real prompt.`
